## 🚀 The Vibe-Coding Story

This project began in **September 2025** as an experiment: *Could I build a complete game using nothing but AI tools?*

With no background in programming, game development, or software engineering, I embarked on a journey powered entirely by AI synergy:

### The Workflow

```
Vision & Direction (Me)
        ↓
Claude Code + Codex CLI (AI Development)
        ↓
Warp Terminal (AI-Powered Workflow)
        ↓
VS Code (Code Review & Refinement)
        ↓
Vibe Survivor (The Result)
```

**Every single aspect was AI-generated:**
- 🎨 **All visuals** - PixelLab AI created every sprite, background, icon, and UI element
- 🎵 **All audio** - ElevenLabs generated all music tracks and sound effects
- 💻 **All code** - Claude Code wrote 100% of the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- 🏗️ **Architecture** - Designed and refactored from 9,300-line monolith to modular system

### What is "Vibe-Coding"?

**Vibe-coding** is the philosophy that drove this project:
> *I bring the vision, the energy, the creative direction. AI brings the technical execution. Together, we build something neither could create alone.*

No tutorials. No Stack Overflow. No copy-paste. Just pure collaboration between human creativity and AI capabilities.

## 🎨 Development Philosophy

### Why Vanilla JavaScript?
Building with zero frameworks was intentional:
- ✅ **Learn fundamentals** - Understand how games actually work
- ✅ **Maximum performance** - No framework overhead
- ✅ **Full control** - Every line serves a purpose
- ✅ **AI-friendly** - Simpler for AI to reason about and maintain
- ✅ **Portable** - Runs anywhere with a browser

### The Refactor Journey
Originally a single 9,300+ line file, the codebase was refactored into a modular architecture:
- **Before:** Monolithic, hard to maintain, performance bottlenecks
- **After:** Clean separation of concerns, optimized systems, scalable

*See [REFACTOR.md](REFACTOR.md) for the complete refactoring story.*
